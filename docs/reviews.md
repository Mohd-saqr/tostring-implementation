- Mention the limitations of the project. Some of them include: The library works only if getters and setters are generated for a POJO class. No need to pass instance and class, we can get class from the instance itself. (v1.2)    
- The output contains getId = 1, getName = "Triguna", can it be like Id = 1, Name = "Triguna"? (v1.2)

- Calendar object prints unnecessary information. Can we change it to print only what is required? (v1.3)
